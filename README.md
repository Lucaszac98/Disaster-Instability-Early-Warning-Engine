## 🔍 How It Works

The Disaster-Instability-Early-Warning-Engine uses two main approaches to predict disaster situations:

1. **Force-Based Instability Modeling:** This examines how forces interact during a potential disaster. It helps identify critical points where disasters could escalate.

2. **Interpretable Machine Learning Layer:** This layer analyzes data and interprets the escalation risk. It blends force-based insights with machine learning, allowing for clearer decision-making and risk assessment.

Together, these methods provide a comprehensive overview of potential disaster scenarios. 

## 🎛️ Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Navigate easily with logical controls designed for non-technical users.
- **Real-Time Data Analysis:** Input current data points to receive instant assessments.
- **Scenario Simulation:** Test various disaster scenarios to see how different factors affect outcomes.
- **Customizable Alerts:** Set up notifications to stay aware of changing risk levels.

## 📖 User Guide

1. **Launching the Application:**
   - After installation, locate the application on your desktop or in the start menu.
   - Double-click to open it.

2. **Inputting Data:**
   - Use the “Data Input” tab to enter relevant information such as geographic location, hazard type, and risk factors.
